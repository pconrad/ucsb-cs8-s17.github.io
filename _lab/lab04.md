<h1>Lab04: NOT READY FOR RELEASE YET!!</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Goals for this lab</h2>

By the time you have completed this lab, you should be able to:
<ol>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ol>

<h2>Step by Step Instructions</h2>
**Step 0:** Get together with your assigned lab partner.

**Step 1:** Log in, and create a lab04 directory
Decide which one of you will be the first pilot for this lab, and then log in to the pilot's account and create a directory called lab04 inside his/her cs8 folder. You will work in this account for the rest of the lab, but remember to switch often between pilot and navigator roles during the course of the lab.

**Step 2:** Bring up IDLE as usual, and open a new window for function definitions
Start IDLE. Then, select &quot;File-&gt;New Window&quot; and add a comment at the top of this new file like the following (with the proper substitutions of course): 

<pre>
# lab04.py
# Your name(s), today's date
# xxxx
</pre>

Then, save it under the name lab04.py inside your lab04 directory.





**Step 5:** Show off your work and get credit for the lab

<table bgcolor="yellow" border="1" cellpadding="4"><tbody><tr><td>
   Get your TA's attention to inspect your work, and to record your lab completion.
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<blockquote>
**Step 5a.**
Your final submission, lab04.py, should now have XXX functions defined therein: one for the factorial function and the other for the coin counter function.

In the unlikely event that you must complete this assignment at CSIL, then submit it with the turnin program. You MUST have both your name and your partner's name in the file in order to receive credit. Remember that the original pilot needs to do this step, since that is whose account you have been using in Phelps 3525. Use the following command after you cd into your cs8/lab04 directory:

<pre>turnin Lab04@cs8 lab04.py</pre>

After answering the questions, be sure to <em>wait for the message indicating success.</em>

<h2>Evaluation and Grading</h2>
Each student must accomplish the following to earn full credit for this lab:
 <ul>
   <li>lab04.py is saved in original pilot's ~/cs8/lab04/ directory.</li>
   <li>lab04.py contains a working XXXXXXXXX function.</li>
 </ul>
